I am currently a **Visiting Scholar** in the College of Engineering at **Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech)**, where I work closely with [A/Prof. Mingkai Zheng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=u439xWYAAAAJ).

My research lies at the intersection of **Generative AI** and **3D/4D Vision**. I am also keen on exploring the transformative potential of Artificial Intelligence in interdisciplinary fields, particularly **AI4Healthcare** (work closely with [Mr. Xiaowen Hu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=falivk4AAAAJ) and [Prof. Wei Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2gqfu9AAAAAJ)) and **AI4Music**.

Prior to joining SUSTech, I obtained my **MSc** degree in **Advanced Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence)** from the **University of Manchester** supervised by [Dr. Tim Morris](http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~tmorris/index.htm), and my **BEng** degree in **Computer Science and Technology** from **Harbin University of Science and Technology** supervised by Jianhui Han.
